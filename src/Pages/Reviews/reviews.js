      "The First thing I wanna mention  abt Vinuta mam is that  she is the best version of a doctor .She is kind, good listener  and more than that she is  concerned abt her patient  more than patient herself.I was diagnosed with chocolate cyst in 2019 and got operated in my native where I had very bad experience. After a month I started seeing doctor vinuta for further checkups based on my relative's referal and that was the best decision I took. Vinuta mam made me so comfortable and she has treated me with so much of care. Unfortunately, I could not see doctor for 6months during covid and  I was diagnosed with cyst second time. I still remember the disappointment on her face when she found cyst formation again in my uterus.As the cyst size was big she had to carry out laproscopy .She carried out around 4 hours surgery where she corrected many mistakes done during my last surgery which was done by doctor in my native. She treated me with so much of love and care.Always I felt like she feels my pain. Post the surgery she tried her best to make me conceive naturally and for my surprise I was conceived naturally after the surgery .I really appreciate her effort , patience and care that she showed towards me throughout my journey till pregnancy.She suggested and talked to couple of doctors so that they can take care of me till delivery .Now I'm  7 months pregnant and still she is still in touch with the doctor who is seeing me. She treated me like a family member.I cant thank her enough. ",
